## About this project

This project is an E-commerce website using React.js & Firebase (DB)

I used redux with redux-saga for the data flow and styled-components for the styling.

User can sign up/ sign in and add items to the cart and complete the payment with Stripe API.

Google firebase auth was used for the authentification process and user may signin using google account.
